== Overview

Redis Input/Output Tools (RIOT) is a set of import/export command line utilities for Redis:

* link:db.html[RIOT DB]: migrate from an RDBMS to Redis, RediSearch, RedisJSON, ...
* link:file.html[RIOT File]: file import and export.
* link:gen.html[RIOT Gen]: generate sample Redis datasets for new feature development and proof of concept.
* link:redis.html[RIOT Redis]: live replication from any Redis database (including AWS Elasticache) to another Redis database.
* link:stream.html[RIOT Stream]: Kafka import and export.

RIOT reads records from a source (file, database, Redis, data generator) and writes them to a target (file, database, Redis).
