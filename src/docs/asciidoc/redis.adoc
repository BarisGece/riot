== Overview

*riot-redis* allows for replicating data between two Redis databases using scan and optionally keyspace notifications (*live* replication).

TIP: Live replication makes use of keyspace notifications. Make sure the source Redis database has keyspace notifications enabled using `notify-keyspace-events = KA` in `redis.conf` or via CONFIG SET.

== Examples

.Live replication from localhost:6379 to localhost:6380
