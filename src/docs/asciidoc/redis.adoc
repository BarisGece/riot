== Overview

Most of the database migration tools available today are offline in nature. Migrating data from AWS ElastiCache to Redis Enterprise Cloud for example means backing up your Elasticache data to an AWS S3 bucket and importing it into Redis Enterprise Cloud using its UI. This implies some downtime and might result in data loss. Other available techniques include creating point-in-time snapshots of the source Redis server & applying the changes to the destination servers to keep both servers in sync. It might sound like a good approach but can be challenging when you have to maintain dozens of scripts to implement the migration strategy. 

*riot-redis* is a migration tool that allows for replicating data between two Redis databases. It implements client-side replication using a producer/consumer approach:

* the producer is connected to the source Redis (e.g. ElastiCache) and iterates over keys to read their corresponding values
* the consumer is connected to the target Redis (e.g. Redis Enterprise Cloud) and writes the key/value tuples previously created

<1> Key reader: initiates a `SCAN` and optionally calls `SUBSCRIBE` to listen for keyspace notifications (live replication).

<2> Value reader: takes the keys and calls `DUMP` and `TTL`.

<3> Key/Value writer: takes key/value/ttl tuples and calls `RESTORE` and `EXPIRE`.

TIP: Live replication makes use of keyspace notifications. Make sure the source Redis database has keyspace notifications enabled using `notify-keyspace-events = KA` in `redis.conf` or via CONFIG SET.
