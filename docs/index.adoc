Get data in and out of Redis

image:riot.svg[RIOT,width=800]

Redis Input/Output Tools (RIOT) is a set of import/export command line utilities for Redis:

* link:riot-db.html[RIOT DB]: migrate from an RDBMS to Redis, RediSearch, RedisJSON, ...
* link:riot-file.html[RIOT File]: file import and export.
* link:riot-gen.html[RIOT Gen]: generate sample Redis datasets for new feature development and proof of concept.
* link:riot-redis.html[RIOT Redis]: live replication from any Redis database (including AWS Elasticache) to another Redis database.
* link:riot-stream.html[RIOT Stream]: Kafka import and export.

== Architecture

RIOT reads records from a source (file, database, Redis, data generator) and writes them to a target (file, database, Redis).

In most cases some processing needs to happen in order to adapt input records to the output.

For example records from  delimited files are string maps (key/value pairs where values are character strings) that look pretty much exactly like Redis hashes.

However you still need to extract keys from those records, i.e. one or more fields should be used to construct the corresponding Redis keys.
