RIOT reads records from a source (file, database, Redis, data generator) and writes them to a target (file, database, Redis).

In most cases some processing needs to happen in order to adapt input records to the output.

For example records from  delimited files are string maps (key/value pairs where values are character strings) that look
pretty much exactly like Redis hashes.

However you still need to extract keys from those records, i.e. one or more fields should be used to construct the
corresponding Redis keys.
