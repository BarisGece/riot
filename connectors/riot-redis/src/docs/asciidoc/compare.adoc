= Compare Redis Databases

This recipe shows you how to use {project-title} to compare two Redis databases.

== Prerequisites

For this recipe you will require the following:
 
* Left-side Redis database
* Right-side Redis database
* {project-title} host machine

== Installing {project-title}

Let's install {project-title} on a host machine. This can be any machine with access to left and right Redis databases.

== Performing Comparison

We are now all set to begin the comparison process.

[source,console]
----
riot-redis -h <left host> -p <left port> compare -h <right host> -p <right port>
----

To show which keys are different use the `--show-diffs` option:

[source,console,subs="attributes,+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <left host> -p <left port> compare -h <right host> -p <right port> [red]#--show-diffs#
----
